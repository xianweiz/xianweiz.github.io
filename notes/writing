xxx becomes inevitable in xxx, which is a major obstacle for xxx
xxx is very challenging, espcially for xxx, due to xxx
xxx is a promising xxx due to xxx. However, xxx

the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
in particular, the major contributions of this paper are as follows:
xxx is build on three primary contributions:
our contributions can be summarized as follows:
the work makes the following contributions:

### Background
the high-level architecture of xxx, based on xxx
as the basic unit of,
consists of, contain, is composed of, is divided/partitioned into

### Motivation
advsersely affect performance, inefficiency, constraints, applicability

guaranteeing perfect functionality across a broad range of systems has become extremely expensive
a fundamental requirement is to understand how xxx affect xxx
it is essential to distinguish and identify

several works have been proposed in the context of xxx
have been actively conducted, have been widely explored in literature
which was later used to
xxx continued the line of research by
recent studies suggest that
many studies tried to xxx
previous studies have mainly used xxx

### Conclusion
in this paper, we address the challenge of xxx
to this end, we propose xxx
in this paper, we present xxx, a xxx
we demonstrate the efficacy of
our methodology is well suited for a large class of workloads
due to these advantages, we believe that xxx has the potential for
