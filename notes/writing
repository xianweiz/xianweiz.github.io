### Design
<High-level>
 suffer from, vulnerable to, susceptible to
 the resultant behavior
 in the presence of data errors, in the absence of systematic methodologies
 simplifying the design of, to accomodate
 introduce a feature known as xxx that, incorporates the features highlighted in ...
 key fatures are briefly highlighted below (and described in detail in subsequent sections)
 we list a few of those new features below.
<Elaborate>
 four modules are instantiated, without loss of generality
 logical organization, resident in, monolythic single-die design
 is private to each CU, lie outside of the, which is part of the,
 is closely associated with, tied together, house all resources, encapsulate

<Applications>
 synthetic workloads, in-situ and composed applications, a collection of applications, a wide variety of suites, and many more
 customer usage patterns
