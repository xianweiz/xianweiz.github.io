### Comment
It looks ok, but it would be nice if the comments were a bit more detailed.
It would be nice if this patch was better commented,
It is not clear what xxx
It is not initially obvious to me why xxx
I am fine with it as-is, but have one suggestion. You can decide if it's worth changing or not.
It has a much better chance of getting approved if xxx
Need to clarify how the default values were chosen.
It is a bit inconsistent using the terms xxx and xxx. That may be sth we want to make clear.

### Review
<Summary>
Targeting at, propose, evaluation

<Strength>
--- motivation
strongly motivated to solve xxx
xxx is definitely desirable
provide excellent insights into xxx
the paper is insightful and interesting
innovative to provide new insights of
several aspects of this paper are appealing
the paper can open a new research direction towards xxx
new research direction that can potentially open up a new work in this field
--- design
the design is useful to facilitate the exploration of xxx
the work is unique in the sense that xxx
make a tangible contribution to xxx
Useful tool/platform
practical to implement in a real system
model details are well elaborated and test is pretty easy to follow
--- evaluation
impressive study with real data
present a number of compelling use cases
a concrete use-case is provided
comprehensive and detaild studies
impressive and comprehensive experimental studies
the discussion and analysis are very insightful
--- writing
conduct a good investigation of existing approaches

<Weakness>
--- novelty
no major new ideas
the novelty of the approach is not clear
limited novelty in terms of xxx
incremental improvement
the work appears rather incremental, applying a known technique from the lierature
stitch together existing techniques to achieve the desired effect
it lacks design innovations and as a full system paper it is not well shaped
--- applicability
applicable to a narrow set of applications
generality of the technique is not clear,
the proposed scheme is quite complex
cannot be deployed in practice on commodity hw with minimal architectural changes
this limits the scope and usefulness of your work
--- flaws
xxx are not considered and even not discussed
xxx claim is dubious
section xxx appears to belie this claim
data to support that claim is missing
doesn't provide sufficient insight into why xxx
there is no clear use case
--- evaluation
extremely weak evaluation
didn't extensively evaluate
no quantitative comparison is done against prior arts
overheads are not well explored
without further justificatio, I would doubt
--- writing
the references are almost a decade old
is very poorly written, missing key ideas
due to rushed writing
need to have a clear definition of
topics that would be nice to cover

<Comment>
I felt some aspects of the paper could be improved
my primary concern is on the xxx
can you provide arguments to highlight novelty and suitability for xxx?
the paper is more suitable for a xxx conference.
the paper could be significantly improved with xxx
use more realistic metrics
how well the approach will generalize to xxx?
issues in comparison with prior works
would the design apply to other xxx?
describe the design in a more elaborate manner
how much feasible it is to xxx

<Discussion>
--- negative
I personally still have concerns with xxx
I still don't think my concern was adequately addressed
overall, I won't be opposed to a reject
I would be more comfortable for the paper to be rejected
the paper needs a proper new iteration
has numerous weakneses, so I am not in favor of accepting it
the response doesn't strongly support the xxx
I am not convinced by the rebuttal and revision
I prefer this paper to be accepted as an short paper
--- positive
we can mark it as on online-accept
I propose we tag this paper as online-accept
I am sticking with my accept
it is a shoo-in
leaning to accept
I remain at my original position, weak accept
I vote accept; for me, there is enough new thrust (e.g., ) to excite the readers
--- neutral
I would prefer to hear more positive reviwers
would like to hear suggestions from other reviewers, maybe the direction and model are prominent engout to get it accepted?
I will keep my score unchanged
after reading other reviews, I think my opinion still holds
what is your most updated opinion on this paper?
would you like to argue against this paper?
a better question is: would you be opposed to acceptance of this paper?
irrespective of what we finally decide, I'd like authors to take note of your criticism and improve the final version
if you feel comfortable, could you write two-three lines specifically pointing out what things could be improved. If not, I'm going to rephrase your comment to use toward that purpose.
let's vote on this: accept/reject. Please (unambiguously) pick only one side.

### Rebuttal
